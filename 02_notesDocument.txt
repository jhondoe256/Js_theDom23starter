The Document -> entry point into the DOM. it contains representations of 'All' content (methods/properties) within a webpage.
Created automatically by the browser whenever we create a new page.

1. Browser loads the page with incomming HTML, CSS
<body>
    <h1>My Grocery List</h1>
    <img src="[imageFile]"/>
    <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
</body>




2. And The Document  assigns values to the incomming HTML And CSS
    These are actually Js objects, and each object can have its own 'properties'
    Also these objects can have relationship(s) with one another.
    the 'Body' is the 'parent' of the 'H1' and the 'Ul'.
    the 'Ul' is the 'parent' of the 'Li'(s).

                                    Document (the top of the 'tree')
                                        |
                                        |
                                        |
                                       Body
                                    /   |    \
                                   /    |     \
                                  /     |      \
                                H1     img      Ul
                                             /   |  \
